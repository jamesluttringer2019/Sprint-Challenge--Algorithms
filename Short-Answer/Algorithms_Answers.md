#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because while loop has n**3, but increments by n**2 so n**3/n**2 = n


b) O(nlogn) since outer for loop is O(n), and each time this loop runs, the inner while loop
also runs, but has O(logn) since the counter doubles each iteration.


c) O(n) since each recursion decreases n by 1
